# ai-question-answering-chatbot
This is a Streamlit-based AI chatbot that leverages LangChain and Ollama to generate intelligent responses to user queries. Users can dynamically choose from multiple LLM models (such as llama3.1, gemma2) and adjust the response creativity using a temperature slider.

⚙️ You can easily extend this chatbot by adding more supported LLM models available in the Ollama ecosystem.
💾 Note: You must download the desired LLM models locally using Ollama (e.g., ollama pull llama3) to run the chatbot effectively.
